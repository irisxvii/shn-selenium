# News Summarizer
This is a Python script that functions as a command-line tool. It allows you to provide your interests, retrieves news articles based on those interests with the help of selenium, and generates summaries using a pre-trained model.
It runs on your computer's terminal and doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI) like a traditional mobile or desktop app.
